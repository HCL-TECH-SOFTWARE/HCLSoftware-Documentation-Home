When you first install Notes, during configuration, you specify a connection that is appropriate for your mail. This connection is most commonly over a local area network (such as broadband). If you want to specify an additional connection later, you may need to add a port. A port is an external socket on a computer into which you can plug a cable or a peripheral device. <\/p>","href":"pref_notes_ports_pref_r.html","attributes":{"data-id":"pref_notes_ports_pref_r"},"menu":{"hasChildren":false},"tocID":"pref_notes_ports_pref_r-d4802e949","topics":[]},{"title":"How can I compress network data for a faster connection?","shortdesc":"<p class=\"shortdesc\">If you have a slow connection to an HCL Domino® server, you may be able to improve HCL Notes® performance by compressing the data that passes between Notes® and the server, if the server administrator also turns data compression on for the server.<\/p>","href":"pref_compress_net_data_t.html","attributes":{"data-id":"pref_compress_net_data_t"},"menu":{"hasChildren":false},"tocID":"pref_compress_net_data_t-d4802e966","topics":[]},{"title":"How can I create and configure a port?","shortdesc":"<p class=\"shortdesc\">The ports Notes® displays in the Communication Ports dialog box depend on the operating system you're using.
